# Nextjs-ish Routing with Deno
Project with the objective to copy Next.js functionalities to Deno.js.

By the moment we only have the router based on pages, but more things will be added in the near future.

## Requirements
Deno 1.0.4

Go to https://deno.land to see how to install Deno.

## Run
Type `make` on command line

## Current folder public and src are only for testing purposes!

## Routing
Deno will walk through the folder `/src/pages` and create the routes using Oak.

## Public Assets folder
The folder `/public` in the root of the application will host you static assets.

## Initial Props
You can get props from server and use on your application.

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

function Page({ props }) {
  return <pre>JSON.stringify(props, null, 2)</pre>;
}

Page.getInitialProps = (context) => {
  return {
    hello: 'world!'
  }
}

export default Page;
```

On this example, you can get the object returned from function getInitialProps and use as you may like.

The context parameter that you get it's the default context that you get from Oak (https://oakserver.github.io/oak/) module.

## Customizable error page
Just create a page at root of `/src/public` with the name `_error.jsx`. The content inside that page, will be your new error page.

When creating an error page, you will get an error object inside props, see example:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

function CustomError({ props }) {
  return <h1>{ props.error.status } - { props.error.message }</h1>
}

export default CustomError;
```

## Dynamic API routes
The folder `/src/pages/api` will return an nom component, you can use it as a simple API creation method.
``` javascript
// index.js
export default function (context) {
  return context.response.body = {
    Hello: "World!",
    method: context.request.method
  };
}
```

When you make GET a request at /api it will return
``` json
{
  "Hello": "World!",
  "method": "GET"
}
```

## API Context
The context param that is received from the handler, is the same that Oak (https://github.com/oakserver/oak) is using.

## Missing pieces:
- [ ] Fix React Hooks (Error from different versions for React, ReactDOM and ReactDOMServer);
- [X] API routes;
- [ ] Styling;
- [X] Get initial props;
- [ ] Get static props;
- [ ] Get server side props;
- [ ] Client side nav (react-router and fix React versions using esm);
- [X] Serve static files;
- [X] Customizable error page;
- [ ] Helpers components (Head, Link);
- [ ] Helper functions (Router, useRouter, etcâ€¦)
- [ ] Remove folders `/public` and `/src` (These files are examples to show how this project works);

## Future plans
In the future this project seeks to create a React application with only two folders, and the rest will be under the hood with this repository, example:
You'll only need the folders that you will use, like the commons:
- `/public`
- `/src/pages`
- `/src/pages/api`
- `/src/components`
- `importmap.json`

Add and with only these folders, run the command `react-server`, and then, Deno will run this repository and serve your content, without configuring anything else.
